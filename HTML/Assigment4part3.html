        Web design refers to the process of designing the visual appearance and
        layout of websites. It involves creating a visual concept, planning the
        layout of web pages, selecting color schemes, and choosing typography
        and images.
        <br />
        Web designers use various tools and technologies to create visually
        appealing and user-friendly websites. These tools include graphic design
        software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and Figma.
        They also use programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
        bring their designs to life on the web.
