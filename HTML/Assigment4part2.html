        Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web
        applications. This involves a combination of different technologies and
        programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create web
        pages and make them interactive.
        <br />
        Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end
        development and back-end development. Front-end development deals with
        the visual aspects of a website or application, including the design,
        layout, and user interface. This involves working with HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed in a browser.
